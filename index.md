Hi, we are developing autonomous artificial intelligence solutions that operate on minimal system requirements. 

Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the fastest-growing research and product development areas. Significant investments in AI are being made in almost every industry, policy, and academic research. These investments have led to new science, medicine, finance, and education applications. 
AI plays a critical role in pushing the boundaries of knowledge and developing new, more efficient approaches to traditional tasks. AI growth is multiplicative, and the trend toward deeper and broader networks has already reached a plateau reserved for the large technology companies with the capital and resources to match. 

However, AI can only deliver value to us if we scale it in a more environmentally sustainable way. This technology can only succeed if we develop a deep understanding of its impact on society and the environment. We must take a deliberate approach to AI research and technology development that considers the environmental impact and takes a responsible approach to advancement. This means AI must be green and environmentally sustainable and not exacerbate climate change. A sustainable mindset for AI that goes beyond software and hardware efficiency is critical to enable future sustainable AI systems. 

To develop AI technologies responsibly, we must achieve competitive model accuracy while maintaining or even reducing computational and environmental costs. 

We are working on solutions to answer these and other questions about sustainable AI applications. For example, applications that work independently (sometimes for months), do not rely on resource-hungry operating systems, and can still handle complex tasks. 
For this purpose, we have created an efficient application to detect Persons that runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico.  

Did we arouse your curiosity? You can find more information on our [blog pages](https://geisten.github.io/posts/), directly on the [GitHub projects](https://github.com/geisten), or by [contacting us directly](mailto:info@geisten.com).
