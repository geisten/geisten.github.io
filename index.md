How small might artificially intelligent applications become? Is it possible to run these systems decentrally without connecting permanently via a data-hungry server? How much is it possible to run these applications on very little energy? 

These are the questions that the geisten project is addressing. We develop solutions based on Deep Learning models with the help of the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) framework and our geisten library. We create applications that can run independently (sometimes for months), do not rely on resource-hungry operating systems, and still accomplish complex tasks. Possible applications are, e.g., the detection of weeds in agricultural areas, the detection of forest fires, or animals in wildlife parks.

Summarized in one sentence: 

> We build intelligent systems that are minimally designed to run in tiny environments.
